// Question 2: Can You Make It Work More Like An Apple II?
//
// You're working as a consultant for an elementary school
// adopting a very complicated learning management system.
//
// A few of the elementary school teachers have come to you.
// They can get their vocabulary words for each week or unit
// as a Javascript object.  They want to use it as input for
// a flashcard program originally written years ago, which
// expects a simple text file, with terms and definitions on
// alternating lines. For instance if the learning
// management system gives you a set of vocabulary words
// like this:

var sixthGradeWords = {
  antagonist: 'someone who offers opposition',
  protagonist: 'the principal character in a work of fiction',
  legacy: 'in law, a gift of personal property by will',
  lore: 'knowledge gained through tradition or anecdote'
};

// Your code should produce the following result:
//
// antagonist
// someone who offers opposition
// protagonist
// the principal character in a work of fiction
// legacy
// in law, a gift of personal property by will
// lore
// knowledge gained through tradition or anecdote
