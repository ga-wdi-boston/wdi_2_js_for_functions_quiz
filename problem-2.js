You're working as a consultant for an elementary school adopting a very complicated learning management system. It's easy to get the vocabulary words for a unit out of the system as a Javascript object.  The teachers would like to use it as input into an old Apple II program that accepts a text file as input, with terms and definitions on alternating lines.  For example:

Input: var sixthGradeWords = {
  antagonist: 'someone who offers opposition',
  protagonist: 'the principal character in a work of fiction',
  legacy: 'in law, a gift of personal property by will',
  lore: 'knowledge gained through tradition or anecdote'
};

Output (written by console.log in a function)
antagonist
someone who offers opposition
protagonist
the principal character in a work of fiction
legacy
in law, a gift of personal property by will
lore
knowledge gained through tradition or anecdote
